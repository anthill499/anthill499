### Welcome to my repository! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! my name is Anthony Huang and I am a 23 year old full-stack software engineer based in New York City. My journey into 
software development started in April 2021 when I picked up my first programming book. Two months after, I joined [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open), a 16 week
intense coding bootcamp that immerses their students in full-stack web development. Since then, I fell in love with programming and the amazing 
people who come with the profession.
